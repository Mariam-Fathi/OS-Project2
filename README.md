# OS-Project2

pzip OS project


Description

For this project, we will implement a parallel version of zip using threads.
We 'll use the run-length encoding (RLE) as the basic technique.

RLE is quite simple: when we encounter n characters of the same type in a row, the compression tool will turn that into the number n and a single instance of the character.

Thus, if we had a file with the following contents: aaaaaaaaaabbbb

The tool would turn it into: 10a4b

Here, we will write out a 4-byte integer in binary format followed by the single character in ASCII. Thus, a compressed file will consist of some
number of 5-byte entries, each of which is comprised of a 4-byte integer and the single character.

â€¢ To determine the number of threads to create. On Linux, the determination of the number of
threads may refer to some interfaces like get_nprocs() and get_nprocs_conf();. Then, we are required to create an appropriate number of threads
to match the number of CPUs available on whichever system our program is running.
